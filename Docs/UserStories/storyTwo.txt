As a user, I want to be able to meet people with similar interests based on my pictures, biography, and Spotify music taste. I need a ‘settings’ link to edit my profile There will be an option to select my photos from my Facebook account, or upload new ones from my device into my profile view. I will be able to set one profile photo and 5 display photos, which I can change at any time. I can also edit my biography and post Spotify playlists at any time.
