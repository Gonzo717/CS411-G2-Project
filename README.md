The application design works as a date matching algorithm. It will analyze profiles in order to match users. Each user profile will include a number of photos, a self summary, and answers to various questions. The application will analyze the sentiment of the users’ texts, utilizing Azure's text sentiment analysis to retrieve data describing the mood of the users. Additionally, Azure’s computer vision API will return labels and a caption describing the contents of the photo. From these API’s, our program will build matches from the user profiles in a dating setting.
