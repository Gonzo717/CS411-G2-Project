As a user, I want to be able to click on a certain tab to view a list of potential match ratings in descending order. There will be a notification button that will indicate if there are strong matches. Matches will be listed on the left window, with messages in the center. Each match listing will have a button that gives me the option to go to the potential matchâ€™s profile, message the potential match, or remove the match from my listings.
